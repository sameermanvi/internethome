A month ago, I participated in my first-ever hackathon — **Hacknight 7.0**, organized by **ACM PESU-ECC**.  
It was an incredible experience where our task was to solve issues in existing repositories and make open-source contributions.

I learned a lot about:

*   ⚙️ **Understanding real-world codebases**
*   🌐 **Collaborating on GitHub**
*   🧩 **Managing issues, pull requests, and version control**
*   💡 **The spirit of open source** — learning, contributing, and growing together

Hackathons like these remind me that learning doesn’t always need a win — sometimes, participation itself is the prize.

Grateful to **ACM PESU-ECC** for organizing such an inspiring event and to all the participants who made it such a memorable experience!
